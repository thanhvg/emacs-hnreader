* why not using hn api
hn api will invole a lot of rest requests which would not be fast for emacs
also the data layout is already available at hn webiste, one curl call and 
then parse them to org would be faster
* parse front page
now what 
* parse comments
          <table border="0" class='comment-tree'>
            <tr class='athing comtr ' id='20724657'>
comment are same level in regard to html node 
but child comments have different ident block width

top level comment
                    <td class='ind'><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td>
child 

                    <td class='ind'><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td>
* CANCELED show number of child comments

Assuming the current buffer is an org-mode buffer, the following code collects paths of file links in the current buffer.

#+begin_example elisp
(org-element-map (org-element-parse-buffer) 'link
  (lambda (link)
    (when (string= (org-element-property :type link) "file")
      (org-element-property :path link))))
#+end_example

In an org buffer, (org-element-parse-buffer) returns the parse tree of the current buffer. And you can map over it with org-element-map.

with the org buffer, run through it find the text prop of htmlize-link

or hack shr insert link

** or a simple way chec in dom for a link and change it
downside is speed, no we need to iterate and look for a tag and then mutate it, the push it back to the dom. Since the dom is a list 

you need to map the whole dom

it works but it seems a bit slow (can't confirm thsi) and long links looks ugly
** got through the buffer look for each char
- get its text properties 'shr-url and 'htmlize-link 
if they are the same then ok, if not assign htmlize-link to value of 'shr-url
better use
